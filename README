This is a small, process-based framework, intended for writing applications that
are defined by plugin-based functionality.

Applications are defined as a set of messages that will be generated and
responded to by some plugin being run by an application. For instance, a music
player might be defined by the commands "play, pause, skipsong, skipalbum". As
long as a combination of plugins results in at least one generator of, and one
listener to, each message required, the application will happily run (perhaps
not with the behaviour you expect though.).

This is currently very much in beta. There are probably massive ugly
problems. Patches welcome.

For an example of an application using this, checkout out Pyrana
